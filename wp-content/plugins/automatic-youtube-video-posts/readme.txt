== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I display the thumbnail for each video in my post lists? =

Add the following code wherever you\'d like the image to appear: `<?php tern_wp_youtube_image(); ?>`

= Why are my latest videos not imported automatically? =

YouTube is massive. So massive in fact that it cannot store all of its videos on a single server. It needs many servers. Servers upon servers. Also, there is constantly new data added to it from all over the world as you can imagine. The computing power needed to run YouTube is extensive. So to account for this YouTube (Google) has a system in place for caching information.

One way you\'ll notice this is that your YouTube video thumbnails aren\'t always added right when you upload your video. This is not because YouTube is broken. It is because it takes time for YouTube to sift through the millions of videos posted.

So, why does the Automatic YouTube Video Posts plugin not always pull the videos in instantly? This is because your YouTube channel\'s feed is not updated instantly. The XML feed of all your videos is where this plugin pulls data about your videos from to create them as posts on your site. Your channel\'s feed does not exist on the same servers at YouTube that your videos do. YouTube has a schedule its servers are updated on. The server your feed is on might update everyday at 1pm. It might update every 3 days. This plugin cannot get videos that do not exist in your feed. This plugin checks your feed daily. If new videos are available it imports them.
