With !Share plugin by Cunjo you can design your own Social Floating Bar and/or Attention Grabber Bar. This plugin also include inline share buttons that can be placed above or under your blog content.

Major new features in !Share 1.5 include:

* Created 2 new bar layouts (Elegant bottom & Elegant left) [core-update]
* Added Social Signal Counters feature for Elegant bars layout & inline buttons (currently the counter returns stats for Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Linkedin, Pinterest, Delicious, Sumbleupon, Digg & Reddit) [core-update]
!Note: if you decide to use other social icons with counters besides the networks specified the counter for those networks will always show 0. Also please keep in mind, the widgets with social counters load slower than without (the script "carries" your blog/website url to all social networks APIs to check for social signals and return the counter).
* Created 2 new share button skins (Elegant & Metro) [core-update]
* All button skins are now available to use for the !Share bars  (Current bars button skins: Theme icons, Shiny, Variety, Satin, Shiny 2, Elegant & Metro) [core-update]
* We added a 3rd option for inline buttons positioning. Now you can select to show the !Share buttons both above and under your page/post content.
* Added a field where you can input the text to be shown in front on the inline buttons. Ie. "Share this article" or "Share this now".
* Changed positioning of Cunjo's !Share icon for inline buttons. (Its now displayed last, after your selected share icons) [core-update]
* Changed Cunjo's !Share icon hover text from "Get this FREE widget" to simply "!Share" (All widgets, bars and inline buttons) [core-update]
* Because we received few bug reports that the inline buttons used on some wp themes are not displaying properly we changed and fixed some issues to make it widely compatible.

IMPORTANT: The !Share Plugin holds the !Share Widget builder form and saves your settings in your Wordpress database, this functionality is under GPL License. The Script that generates the actual share buttons/bars is hosted on cunjo.com server and is a Free Service provided by cunjo.com. You have to register for a Free !Share ID and agree with our Terms and Conditions.

PS: You'll need a FREE !Share ID to use it. Once you generate the ID from your !Share Dashboard in Settings > !Share check your email and copy the share ID from the cunjo email received. Paste the code in the right side form and activate.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin archive and upload it to your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Go to the Plugins page in your WordPress Administration area and click 'Activate' for !Share.
!Note: If you are already using the embedded version on your blog please remove the embedded code in order for the plugin to work properly.
3. Click on 'Settings' under the plugin name or go to Settings > !Share
4. Enter your !Share ID on the right hand side Form. If you do not have a !Share ID just generate one with the left hand side Form. You will receive an email with your new ID.
5. Activate the Share & Message Bar an Share Simple Buttons by clicking on the 'Disabled' icons on each one's row.
6. Design your Share Bar and Buttons by going trough the Visual Editor Steps.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I already have a !Share ID from cunjo.com/share, can I use that one? =

Yes. If you previously generated a !Share ID from our website you can use it on your plugin. Insert the id in the right hand side form after installation and the system will approve it.

= Can I use my !Share ID on multiple wordpress installations? =

Yes. Your !Share ID is Universal. You can Use it on as many blogs as you like.

= Can I use both the Share Bar and inline share buttons in the same time? =

Yes. Unlike the embedded version, with the !Share plugin you can use both share widget styles.

= Can I design and use more that one !Share Bar in the same time on a blog? =

No. The way the whole plugin is built will allow you the use of only one share bar at time. Frankly we do not see the point of showing multiple share bars in the same time.

= My Share bar is not showing on my blog, what might be the issue? =

The plugin is 100% built and integrated with wordpress functionalities, functions and hooks. The first guess might be that you have a buggy plugin in conflict with ours. Try to spot that plugin by deactivating each of your plugins one at a time and each time refresh your blog page, if after deactivating a plugin the !Share bar appears on your blog it means you found the buggy plugin. If nothing works contact the Cunjo Support team at support@cunjo.com and we will take a look for you.
